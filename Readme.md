This fork was made as part of the research assignment project by Mariano Ramirez, to make the Metacontrol packages work with
the TIAGo robot. See the ['metacontrol_experiments'](https://github.com/MRamirez25/metacontrol_experiments/tree/models21_experiments)
repository to see how to run the simulation and perform experiments. 

This repository was forked from [this repository](https://github.com/JWijkhuizen/metacontrol_move_base_configurations), 
which in turn was forked from [this repository](https://github.com/rosin-project/metacontrol_move_base_configurations). 
The files in this specific repository were not autogenerated, they are actually essentially the same as the files in 
the first repository mentioned above owned by Jasper Wijkhuizen, with small edits to the launch files (see the
[commit](https://github.com/MRamirez25/metacontrol_move_base_configurations/commit/986109b67dac8d175954ce2f4a51fb6764a45c34);
the python file to easily and quickly edited the launch files is also included) so that they would work with the TIAGo robot. 
Thus note that the parameters in these launchfiles **have not been tested specifically for TIAGo**. While they seem to 
work in simulation, the parameters likely need to be edited or tuned to TIAGo, since they were chosen with the Boxer 
robot in mind. 

##  metacontrol_move_base_configurations 

This repository contains files autogenerated by the [ROS tooling](https://github.com/ipa320/ros-model/)

Technical Maintainer: [**ipa-nhg**](https://github.com/ipa-nhg/) (**Nadia Hammoudeh Garcia**, **Fraunhofer IPA**) - **nadia.hammoudeh.garcia@ipa.fraunhofer.de**

The repository [metacontrol_models_experiment](https://github.com/rosin-project/rosin-experiments/tree/master/metacontrol_models_experiment) holds the script and the base models used to auto-create the ROS packages of this repository. To re-generate them we strongly recommend the use of the following instructions:

```
cd 
mkdir rosin-experiment
cd rosin-experiment
git clone https://github.com/rosin-project/rosin-experiments/
git clone https://github.com/rosin-project/metacontrol_move_base_configurations
cd rosin-experiments/metacontrol_models_experiment/MoveBaseConfigurations
./create_config_combination_move_base.sh
```
The last command will create a folder that includes a rossystem file for each configuration under `rosin-experiments/metacontrol_models_experiment/src-gen` .

Open the ROS tooling (latest release version from May 20th) , press the ["import common ROS objects" button ](https://github.com/seronet-project/SeRoNet-examples/blob/master/SeRoNet-Tooling-ROS-Mixed-Port/ROS-MixedPort-Examples/ROSMixedPortTutorials_WSsetup.md#ros-workspace-setup) and import the project: rosin-experiments/metacontrol_models_experiment/.

Automatically the ROS deployable artifacts for all your rossystem configuration will be created, that for the current version of the ROS tooling this means a rospackage that includes a launch file.

```
cd rosin-experiments/metacontrol_models_experiment/src-gen
cp f*_v*_r* ../../../metacontrol_move_base_configurations -rf
cd ../../../metacontrol_move_base_configurations
git checkout -b NewConfigs
git commit -am "new auto-genarted rossystem and launch files"
git push origin NewConfigs
```
